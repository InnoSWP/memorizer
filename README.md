# Memorizer App

## **Project Description**

The project is based on the idea of making an application that is about making the process of 
memorization of any text a lot easier by listening to it. To start memorizing the user need to 
upload or type text in the application and then use the player. The user can use the screen or 
voice commands to manage the amount of repetitions per sentence, stop/start the audio, go to the 
next sentence, etc.

## **How to use**

When you start the app you will be on the home screen. Here you can upload your text for memorizing 
either by typing it or by uploading a PDF file.

After inserting your text tap “Memorize” to start memorizing the text. You will go to the 
memorizing screen. Here you can listen to the text and manage the audio using audio player buttons. 
Furthermore, you can interact with audio player by voice commands. For that, tap “microphone” 
button and say a desirable command. You can find all the information about the voice commands 
by tapping “information” button.
